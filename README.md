# NFL Draft Board

## Introduction
This starts a concept by Me (Adam Olsen) and Dylan Cabral. The purpose of this application is to provide fantasy football (and down the road possibly other sports) leagues the opportunity to enjoy the feeling of doing an in-person draft, while also not requiring older solutions such as pen and paper such as this:

## How the application might look
Right now is still in the development phase, but early concepts are going to be added on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/TthYzGLWqDPnMYUFNs7nRB/NFL-Draft-Board?node-id=0-1&t=6e756Na5eeJaGLoE-1)

## Disclaimer
**Much of this work is still in progress, but I look forward to seeing where I can bring this project. I am excited to use Python and CustomTKinter to try and develop my front-end skills, especially as I have specialized in back-end my whole coding career.**
